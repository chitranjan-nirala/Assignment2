# Even or Odd Check and Sum Calculation Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

1. **Check if a Number is Even or Odd**: Determines whether a given integer is even or odd.
2. **Sum of Integers from 1 to 50**: Calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <repository-name>
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Program Descriptions

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
- Displays the result accordingly.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
- Displays the final sum.

## Example Output
```
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is 1275.
